On the console the user enters the 3x3 matrix, with 0 considered as an empty space. The matrix first fills up the rows then columns. 

The code saves the matrix the user enters as the root node of the tree, with each successive node coming out of due to the valid shifting of tiles as its children, and so on.

 The code takes considers the possibilities on the positions that empty space can shift to and makes the shifting accordingly, through Breadth First Search.
